  # Improve Authentication Configuration

  1. Notes
    - For production: Disable email confirmation in Supabase Dashboard
    - Navigate to: Authentication > Settings > Email Auth
    - Uncheck "Enable email confirmations"
    - This allows immediate signup without email verification

  2. Alternative Approach
    - Keep email confirmation enabled for security
    - Handle unconfirmed users gracefully in the app
    - Send reminder emails to unconfirmed users

-- This migration serves as documentation
-- Actual email confirmation settings are configured in Supabase Dashboard
-- No database changes needed for this configuration
